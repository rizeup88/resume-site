      <h1>Hi there, I'm Chase Smith.</h1>

    <div class="intro">
      <h1>A brief introduction...</h1>
      <p>As a Website & UX/UI designer, you could say, the internet is my place of inspiration, and my devices are my art canvas.</p>
      <p>After three years of professional web and UX/UI Design experience, I never seek to stop developing my skills and perspective to change with the times. I am familiar with all phases of the Design process including User-Research, Wireframing, Full-Scale Design, Front-End Development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), User-Testing, and Implementation/Presentation.</p>
      <p>I also possess a Bachelors Degree in Business Management, and six years of e-Commerce work experience creating complete technological solutions for customers of all walks of life.</p>
      <p>I especially enjoy designing mobile apps, as well as webpages, but am always open to learning both new forms of Design, as well as new software developed to evolve mobile/desktop design.</p>
      <p>I am currently looking for full-time or contract work as a Designer, though I am open to freelance work as well. </p>
